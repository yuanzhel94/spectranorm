## Installation
You can install the package using pip:

```sh
pip install spectranorm --upgrade
```

Installation typically takes less than 1 minute on a standard laptop with an internet connection.

## Requirements

SpectraNorm is implemented in Python and depends on several standard scientific Python libraries, including:

- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- nibabel
- joblib
- pymc

All dependencies are automatically installed via pip.

While SpectraNorm should work in any Python 3.10+ environment, it has been specifically tested on a conda environment on a Linux machine running Python 3.12.
